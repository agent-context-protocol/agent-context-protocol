However, iPhone sales growth has slowed globally (+0.4% in 2024), with a sharp 44% decline in China.\",\n        \"Services Expansion\": \"High-margin services (Apple Music, App Store, etc.) are growing at double-digit rates, contributing to recurring revenue and offsetting hardware saturation. Services now account for ~25% of total revenue.\",\n        \"Emerging Markets\": \"India and Southeast Asia are critical growth targets, with Apple planning retail expansions and localized production.\"\n      },\n      \"Profitability and Shareholder Returns\": {\n        \"EPS Growth\": \"Aggressive share buybacks reduced shares outstanding from 22.3 billion in 2015 to 15 billion in 2025, boosting EPS by 10% in Q1 2025. Analysts project 9-11% annual EPS growth through 2030.\",\n        \"Margin Pressures\": \"Net income fell 35.8% YoY in September 2024 due to rising operating costs and a 50.2% effective tax rate. Gross margins remain stable at ~43%, supported by premium pricing.\"\n      },\n      \"Innovation and Strategic Initiatives\": {\n        \"AI Integration\": \"\\\"Apple Intelligence\\\" features in iOS 18 aim to drive a 2025-2027 iPhone upgrade cycle, with Wedbush predicting a $325 stock target. Delays in China (lack of local AI partner) pose risks.\",\n        \"New Markets\": \"Rumored ventures into EVs and AR/VR devices could diversify revenue but face execution risks.\"\n      },\n      \"Financial Health and Valuation\": {\n        \"Cash Reserves\": \"$65.2 billion in liquidity supports R&D and shareholder returns. Free cash flow surged 180% to $34.5 billion in 2024.\",\n        \"Valuation Concerns\": \"Trading at 32.8x trailing earnings (above 10-year average of 19x).
