1. **Numbers**:
   * If the answer contains a relevant number, return the number without commas, units, or punctuation.
   * If the number represents thousands, return the number in thousands.
   * Perform necessary unit conversions based on the context provided in the question. For example, convert picometers to Angstroms if the question implies this.
   * Retain the original precision of the number unless specific rounding instructions are given.
   * Numbers should be written as digits (e.g., 1000000 instead of "one million").

2. **Dates**:
   * If the answer contains a date, return it in the same format provided.

3. **Strings**:
   * Exclude articles and abbreviations.
   * Write digits in numeric form unless specified otherwise.
   
4. **Lists**:
   * If the answer is a comma-separated list, return it as a comma-separated list, applying the above rules for numbers and strings.

5. **Sentences**:
   * If the answer is a full sentence and the question expects a detailed explanation, preserve the sentence as is.
   * If the answer can be reduced to "Yes" or "No", do so.

Important:
1. Carefully interpret the question to determine the appropriate format for the answer, including any necessary unit conversions.
2. No need to give a summary of the intermediate steps please provide the the final formatted answer only.
3. The final formatted answer should be as concise as possible, directly addressing the question without any additional explanation or restatement.
4. Exclude any additional details beyond the specific information requested.
5. If unable to solve the question, make a well-informed EDUCATED GUESS based on the information we have provided. Your EDUCATED GUESS should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. 
6. DO NOT OUTPUT 'I don't know', 'Unable to determine', etc. Always try to guess the best plausible answer through EDUCATED GUESS.
