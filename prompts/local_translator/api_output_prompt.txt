### Your Task:

1. Analyze the API Response for the Current Step:
   - Verify if the API response is plausible, relevant, and complete based on the expectations from the current step.
   - Determine if the response contains the necessary information to fulfill the Output Variables specified in the Step Details.

2. Process and Extract Data for the Current Step:
   - Extract the relevant information from the API response to create the Output Variables for the current step.
   - Format the data according to the expected data type (e.g., JSON, Array, String).
   - Ensure the data is presentable and suitable for display or further processing. Include important information like unit of things if availableor additional context based on API Documentation, such that it is easy to understand.

3. Assess and Fulfill Dependencies:
   - Identify any dependent steps that rely on the output of the current step.
   - Determine if the API response contains sufficient information to fulfill the Input Variables required by the dependent steps.
   - Extract and format the necessary data for each dependent step's Input Variables, matching the expected data types and formats.

4. Handle Errors Appropriately:
   - 603 INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION: Raise this error if the API response is not plausible, relevant, or complete for the current step.
   - 604 DEPENDENCY_INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION: Raise this error if the API response lacks sufficient information to fulfill the dependencies for future steps.
   - Only raise errors in extreme cases, not for minor issues or partial data availability.

5. Output the Processed Data:
   - Provide a CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT where you document your reasoning and the steps taken to process the data.
   - Present the API_RESPONSE including:
     - Status_Code: Indicate the status code and status text.
     - Output_Variables: Provide the processed output variables for the current step.
     - Dependent_Input_Variables: Provide the processed data for dependent steps' input variables.

6. Maintain Strict Adherence to the Output Format:
   - Do not include additional details or change the structure.
   - Ensure clarity and correctness in variable names, data types, and content.
   - Use valid JSON format where applicable.

8. Filling in the Output_Variables and Dependent_Input_Variables:
   - Try to include all the important information about the output in the respective output variables or the dependent input variables. For example if you are mentioning about quantitites then inlcude its units.

### Important Guidelines:

- CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT:
  - Begin by evaluating if the API response contains the information needed for the current step.
  - Extract and format the relevant data for the Output Variables.
  - Next, assess whether the API response provides the necessary information for dependent steps.
  - Extract and format the required data for each dependent step's Input Variables.
  - Think about what all information from the api output should be extracted such that things are understandable and complete. Utilize the api documentation present in the chat history.

- Error Handling:
  - Raise 603 INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION if the API response is insufficient for the current step.
  - Raise 604 DEPENDENCY_INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION if the API response is insufficient for dependent steps.
  - Provide a clear explanation in the Error_Explanation section.
  - Only raise errors in extreme cases, not for minor or partial data issues.

- Data Validation and Formatting:
  - Ensure all extracted data matches the expected data types and formats specified.
  - For lists or multiple items, use appropriate data structures to organize the data.
  - Validate that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.

- No Additional Explanations:
  - Do not include apologies, justifications, or any text outside the specified output format.
  - Keep the output concise and strictly adhere to the format.

### Remember:

- The accuracy and format of your output directly impact the workflow's success.
- Strictly adhere to the output format and guidelines.
- Provide clear and concise information without additional explanations.
- Raise errors appropriately and provide clear explanations when necessary.
- Include important information like unit of things if availableor additional context based on API Documentation, such that it is easy to understand.
- Try to include all the important information about the output in the respective output variables or the dependent input variables such that the extracted value contains all the context. For example if you are mentioning about quantitites then inlcude its units.

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

- The API response provides geographic coordinates for both Denver, USA, and Delhi, India, which aligns with the expected output variables of the current step.
- For the current step, the Output Variables "latitudes_data" and "longitudes_data" require the latitude and longitude of both locations. The response contains this data clearly, and the values for both cities can be extracted and formatted appropriately.
- The extracted latitudes for Denver and Delhi are 39.742043 and 28.679079, respectively, while the longitudes are -104.991531 for Denver and 77.069710 for Delhi.
- For the dependent step (Panel 1, Step 2), the input variables "latitudes_data" and "longitudes_data" need to be passed as floats to retrieve the current weather data for these locations. These extracted values meet the requirements for the dependent step.

#### Example 4: Error Handling

Input:

Current Step Details:

- API: Perplexity  
- Handles: Retrieves latitude and longitude of Denver, USA and Delhi, India  
- Input Variables:
  - Name: query_get_coordinates
    - Parameter: query
    - Type: string
    - Source: LLM_Generated  
    - Description: Query to get the coordinates of Denver, USA and Delhi, India  
    - Value: "What are the latitude and longitude of Denver, USA and Delhi, India?"
- Output Variables:
  - Name: latitudes_data
    - Description: Latitude of Denver, USA and Delhi, India?
  - Name: longitudes_data
    - Description: Longitude of Denver, USA and Delhi, India?

Dependent Input Variables Step:

API Response:

The geographic coordinates for Denver, USA is as follows:
Denver, USA
Latitude: 39.742043
Longitude: -104.991531.

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

- The API response provides the geographic coordinates for Denver, USA, but it is missing the coordinates for Delhi, India, which is a crucial part of the expected output.
- The Output Variables for the current step, "latitudes_data" and "longitudes_data," require coordinates for both Denver and Delhi. Since the response only includes data for Denver, the response is incomplete for the current step.
- This incomplete information will also affect any dependent steps that rely on the full set of coordinates (latitude and longitude) for both Denver and Delhi.
- As a result, the lack of coordinates for Delhi means the API response cannot satisfy the expected output and dependent input variables. Therefore, the appropriate action is to raise error 601 INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION to signal that critical data is missing from the API response.

$$API_RESPONSE$$

Status_Code

604 INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION

Error_Explanation

The API response does not provide the geographic coordinates for Delhi, India. Thus the response remainse incomplete.
