Example Request:
GET https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?q=air%20pollution&category=general&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY


### Your Task:

1. Verify Input Variables:
   - Carefully review the `Name`, `Parameter`, `Type`, `Source`, `Description`, and `Value` of each input variable.
   - Verify that the parameter names are correct, types match the expected format according to the API documentation, and values (if provided) are valid. If the `Source` is from a previous API output (e.g., API_Output (Panel 1, Step 1)), confirm that the relevant data is indeed produced in the earlier step.
   - If there is a conflict, such as a parameter name mismatch or an incorrect data type that cannot be resolved, raise an error by outputting `ERROR` at this step. Otherwise, continue with finalizing the API request.

2. Finalize the API Request:
   - HTTP Method: Identify the appropriate method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) based on the API documentation.
   - API Endpoint URL: Combine the base URL with the specific endpoint path and integrate any parameters into the URL as needed.
   - Headers: Include all required headers, such as `Authorization` tokens and `Content-Type`, according to the API documentation.
   - Request Body: If the API requires a body, construct it in valid JSON format, ensuring that all required parameters are included. Handle dynamic values from the input variables (e.g., `vacation_spots_list`) correctly.

3. Output the Finalized API Request:
   - The output should be strictly structured under two main sections:
     - $$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$: This section should contain your reasoning for constructing the API request. Think about:
       - Are the input variable details (name, parameter, type, source, description, and value) correct based on the API documentation?
       - Does the API documentation specify this parameter and type?
       - What method should be used (GET, POST, etc.)?
       - What should be the endpoint URL, headers, and body?
       - How do dependencies between previous API outputs and this step's inputs affect the request?
     - $$API_REQUEST$$: This section should contain the actual API request that will be executed, including method, URL, headers, and body. Ensure that the body strictly follows the structure and format specified by the API documentation.

### Important Guidelines:

- Strict Adherence to the Output Format:
  - Do not include additional details or change the structure.
  - Ensure that the method, URL, headers, and body are clearly specified under their respective headings.
  - The body should be in valid JSON format (when applicable).
  - If there is no need for a body (e.g., when using a GET request with parameters passed via URL), omit the body and only provide the endpoint and headers.

- Variable References:
  - Use the exact variable names provided in the Input Variables.
  - Ensure that sources are correctly indicated in comments within the body for each parameter.

- No Additional Explanations:
  - Do not provide explanations, apologies, or any text outside the specified output format.
  - Your output should be limited strictly to the finalized API request as per the format.

- Handling Multiple Runs for a List of Inputs:
  - If the Input Variables contain a list (e.g., multiple vacation spots), format your API request to accommodate this.
    - For URL Parameters:
      - Use placeholders with curly braces `{}` in the URL to indicate where each item from the list should be inserted.
      - Example:  
        URL: https://api.example.com/news?query={vacation_spots_list}&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
    - For Body Parameters:
      - If the API accepts arrays, pass the array directly. If the API requires separate requests for each item, you may need to iterate over the array and execute the API multiple times.
      - Example:  
        Body:  
        {  
            "locations": [vacation_spots_list], 
            "other_param": "value"
        }
  - This ensures the API can process the list according to its capabilities, whether through multiple requests or handling the entire list in a single request.

- Validation:
  - Double-check that all required parameters are included and correctly formatted.
  - Verify that the request aligns with the API documentation provided.
  - Ensure that the parameter types, names, and values strictly match what the API expects.

### Your Goal:

- Finalize a validated API request that is ready for execution.
- Ensure strict adherence to the output format and avoid any changes in structure.
- If any conflicts arise (e.g., incorrect parameter names, types, or unresolved dependencies), output `ERROR` to halt the process.
- Always only output the CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and API_REQUEST without any other details before or after.
- You should build the API url, header, body in order to get a response that is as short as possible, while still getting the necessary information to answer the question. Pay attention to deliberately exclude any unnecessary pieces of data in the API call. For this if the api has page and pagesize parameters then you can use them to limit the pagesize to less than 15 with page being 1.


### Output Format (Strictly follow this)

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

- In this section, you need to think aloud and explain why the chosen parameters, methods, and structure are correct for the API being executed.
- Consider the following aspects when writing your chain of thought:
  - Input Variables: Are the parameter names, types, and sources correct? Do they match the API documentation? If the source is `LLM_Generated`, is the generated value correct based on the task description? Is the value stored in the variable a list, if yes and the API accepts arguments one at a time then we will have to run the API multiple times.
  - Dependencies: Are there any dependencies on previous API outputs? Is the data from previous steps being used correctly? Is there any missing or conflicting data?
  - HTTP Method & Endpoint URL: Is the method appropriate for the task? Is the endpoint URL correct, and are any required parameters incorporated into it?
  - Headers: Are the necessary headers (such as authorization) included?
  - Request Body: If the API uses a request body, is it structured correctly in JSON format? Are dynamic values placed appropriately, and do they match the expected input types?
  - See if the api has parameters to limit the output of the api like page and pagesize. If yes then we want less than 15 pagesize and page 1 or whatever might be equivalent to this for the specific api.

$$API_REQUEST$$

- After reasoning through the problem in the $$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$, output the finalized API request in the format below:

API_ENDPOINT

Method: [HTTP Method]  
URL: [Full API Endpoint URL]

HEADERS

Header-Name: Header-Value  
Header-Name: Header-Value  
...

BODY

{
    "parameter1": value1,  // Source: [LLM_Generated | API_Output (Panel X, Step X)]
    "parameter2": "value2", // Source: [Fixed Value as per API Documentation]
    ...
}

### Remember:

- Any deviations from the API documentation or the output format can result in errors during execution.
- If you encounter any issues that prevent you from finalizing the API request (e.g., missing required inputs, conflicts in parameters), you should raise an error detailing the issue.

Example Request:
GET https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category=business&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY

# Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

- Input Variables Verification:
  - Name: vacation_spots_list
    - Parameter: q
    - Type: string
    - Source: API_Output (Panel 1, Step 1)
    - Value: ["delhi", "mumbai", "pondicherry", "goa", "ladakh", "meghalaya"]
    - Validation:
      - The API parameter `q` expects a string.
      - `vacation_spots_list` is a list of strings.
      - Since `q` accepts a single string and does not accept an array, we need to make separate API requests for each vacation spot.
  - All input variables are valid and match the API documentation.

- HTTP Method & Endpoint URL:
  - Method: GET
  - Base URL: https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines
  - We will construct the URL for each vacation spot by including the `q` parameter with the vacation spot name and the `apiKey`.
  - Since we have multiple vacation spots, we will put it like {vacation_spots_list}, which will indicate to iterate over the list and make individual requests.

- Headers Setup:
  - No additional headers are required according to the API documentation.

- Request Body:
  - No request body is needed for a GET request.

- The API has page and pagesize input parameters, so we should set the pagesize = 15 and page = 1
