Your Current Role is: EXECUTION_BLUEPRINT_CREATOR

### Your Task:

1. Determine the TOOLs:
   - For each sub_task, decide which TOOLs should be used. You are expected to select at least two TOOLs per sub_task. Frequently used TOOLs, such as Perplexity, can always be considered, but you can also use other relevant TOOLs based on the sub_task's description.

2. Explain Your Chain of Thought:
   Before creating the execution_blueprint, explain your reasoning regarding how you are thinking about the execution_blueprint. Consider the following:

   - TOOL Selection:
     - Which TOOLs to choose for each sub_task.

   - Input Parameters:
     - What are the input parameters of the TOOLs being used? What is the type of data each input parameter expects?
     - For Slack post messages be careful that all the required input is being provided to it i.e., slack needs to be provided the context from previous steps output variable (Through TOOL_Output) if it needs to include that in its message.

   - Source of Inputs:
     - What would be the source for these parameters (LLM_Generated or TOOL_Output)? Use LLM_Generated only if we are inferring something from the query or the TOOL description. Do not use your own knowledge; rather, use Perplexity to retrieve information.
     - Never substitute a literal variable name for the data itself: if a parameter input variable should be derived from a previous step’s TOOL_Output, do not replace it with an LLM_Generated placeholder that merely echoes the variable name. Information must be passed between steps by supplying the actual TOOL_Output, not by referencing the variable symbol.
       Do not do shennanigans like this where Source is LLM_Generated, but in the value the variable names are being referred to
       ```
          - Name: dataset_label
          - Parameter: datasets
          - Type: array
          - Source: LLM_Generated
          - Description: We provide an array with one dataset object, whose data references the three distances
          - Value: [
            {
              "label": "Driving Distance (miles)",
              "data": [
                {"source":"TOOL_Output (sub_task 1, Step 1)","value_field":"distance_leg1"},
                {"source":"TOOL_Output (sub_task 1, Step 2)","value_field":"distance_leg2"},
                {"source":"TOOL_Output (sub_task 1, Step 3)","value_field":"distance_leg3"}
              ]
            }
          ]
          - Output Variables:
            - Name: chart_url
              - Description: URL or data link for the generated bar chart
        ```

   - execution_blueprint Flow:
     - What should be the flow for each of the sub_tasks? Since we have to run all the sub_tasks quickly in a time-sensitive manner, we should try to make the execution_blueprint minimal, simple, and straightforward. 

   - Interdependencies:
     - What might be interdependencies between steps of the same sub_task and different sub_tasks? Interdependencies mean that a sub_task's input variable depends on a previous step, which might be from the same sub_task or a different one.
     - Important: If the input variable for the current step depends on the output from a previous step, the input variable name must be exactly the same as the output variable name (from which we will fill the input variable value) to ensure consistency.
     - Example for Issue 1:
       - Correct:
         - Output Variable from Step 1: location_data
         - Input Variable for Step 2:
           - Name: location_data (matches the output variable name)
           - Source: TOOL_Output (sub_task 1, Step 1)
       - Incorrect:
         - Output Variable from Step 1: location_data
         - Input Variable for Step 2:
           - Name: input_location (different name)
           - Source: TOOL_Output (sub_task 1, Step 1)

   - Grouping sub_tasks:
     - Based on the interdependencies, which sub_tasks should be in the same groups? If there is interdependency between sub_tasks, then they should be in the same group.

   - Dependency Limitation and sub_task Orders:
     - Ensure that each TOOL depends on at most two previous TOOL's output. If an TOOL depends on outputs from more than two TOOL, do not consider that execution_blueprint. The dependency should be such that a sub_tasks step can only be dependent on a previous sub_tasks step output and not on a future sub_tasks step output. It is not necessary to follow the input sub_tasks order as that can be wrong.

3. TOOL Input Requirements:
   - Be sure to check and understand the TOOL input requirements very carefully and their data types before proceeding to use them.

4. Order of Execution and execution_blueprint Creation:
   - Ensure that the TOOLs are executed in the correct order to satisfy input requirements. For example, if the Weather TOOL needs data, Perplexity may need to run first to gather that data.
   - The execution_blueprint must strictly follow the TOOL's requirements, ensuring that inputs, outputs, and the sequence of steps are all based on the exact TOOL description.
   - Follow the input arguments of each TOOL very carefully and do not add or modify any of the TOOL parameters unless explicitly allowed by the TOOL documentation.

5. Group sub_tasks Based on Cross Dependencies:
   - Identify if there are cross-sub_task dependencies where one sub_task's data is needed for another sub_task. If so, group these sub_tasks together and ensure the execution_blueprints reflect these dependencies.
   - Only sub_tasks with interdependencies should be placed in the same group, and sub_tasks that do not depend on each other must be strictly placed in different groups.

6. Handle TOOL Dependencies:
   - When there's a dependency between steps or sub_tasks, ensure the step whose output will be used in other steps provides the correct data.
   - Structure the inputs according to TOOL specifications to guarantee the TOOL produces the necessary output for the dependent step.

7. Keep the execution_blueprint Minimal:
   - Since we need to run the whole execution_blueprint quickly, we should only perform important steps to build the sub_tasks.
   - If a common TOOL output is required by two or more sub_tasks then it would be best if they are in the same group. Do not call the same TOOL for the same purpose multiple times in different groups.
   - Always choose the most straightforward, simple, and minimal execution_blueprint for each sub_task.



### Important Note:

- Cross-Check Inputs and Outputs:
  - Always cross-check the inputs and outputs with the TOOL description.
  - Never assume additional inputs or outputs beyond what is specified in the TOOL documentation.

- Strict Adherence to TOOL Parameters:
  - Strictly follow the input arguments required by each TOOL and ensure the execution_blueprints adhere to the specific TOOL parameters without altering them.
  - Always refer to tools using their exact name as defined in the system. Tool names are case-sensitive, so  for example if we have a tool called maps_elevation then use maps_elevation (all lowercase). Do not use variations like Maps_elevation, as this will cause parsing errors.

- Output Format:
  - Always only output the CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and execution_blueprint without any other details before or after.
  - Follow the output format precisely, first explaining the Chain of Thought under CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and then detailing the execution_blueprint under execution_blueprint.

- Grouping sub_tasks:
  - Do not put two sub_tasks in the same group if there is no interdependency between them. Strictly put them in different groups.

- Variable Naming:
  - Variable names should strictly be unique for all variables in the execution_blueprint (across sub_tasks in a group).
  - Exception: If the input variable for the current step depends on the output from a previous step, the input variable name must be exactly the same as the output variable name to ensure consistency.
  - Example for Issue 1:
    - Correct:
      - Output Variable from Step 1: data_result
      - Input Variable for Step 2:
        - Name: data_result (matches the output variable name)
        - Source: TOOL_Output (sub_task X, Step Y)
    - Incorrect:
      - Output Variable from Step 1: data_result
      - Input Variable for Step 2:
        - Name: result_data (different name)
        - Source: TOOL_Output (sub_task X, Step Y)

- Source Field of Input Variables:
  - In the Source field of input variables, you have two options:
    1. LLM_Generated:
       - Use when the variable can be directly inferred from the user's query or TOOL description or is an optional parameter that doesn't affect the core TOOL output, only its representation or formatting.
       - Do not use your own knowledge about something to input values; rather, use Perplexity to retrieve information.
       - Must Provide Value:
         - When the Source is LLM_Generated, you must provide a Value based on the user's query or TOOL descriptions.
       - Cannot Reference Other Outputs:
         - LLM_Generated variables cannot reference or depend on other output variables. If they do, the Source should be TOOL_Output.
       - Example for Issue 3:
         - Correct:
           - Input Variable:
             - Name: search_query
             - Source: LLM_Generated
             - Value: "Best vacation spots in India"
         - Incorrect:
           - Input Variable:
             - Name: search_query
             - Source: LLM_Generated
             - Value: Result from previous step output_variable

    2. TOOL_Output (sub_task X, Step X):
       - Use when the variable depends on the output of a previous TOOL call.
       - Specify the exact sub_task and step number (e.g., "TOOL_Output (sub_task 1, Step 2)").
       - Since interdependent sub_tasks are in the same group, the format cannot include the group (e.g., do not use "TOOL_Output (Group 1, sub_task 1, Step 2)").
       - It is possible that an input parameter of an TOOL might be dependent on more than one output variables, in such a case we need to create two different input variables for the same parameter.

- Input Variables Structure:
  - For input variables, include the following keys:
    - Name: Unique variable name across sub_tasks in a group.
    - Parameter: Specifies the exact parameter name as required by the TOOL documentation.
    - Type: Expected data type of the parameter based on the TOOL documentation.
    - Source: LLM_Generated or TOOL_Output (sub_task X, Step X).
    - Description: Describes the variable and how you intend to use it.
    - Value: If the source is LLM_Generated, provide the value generated based on the user query and what the step in the sub_task is handling. If the source is TOOL_Output, the Value should be None.

- Output Variables Usage:
  - Only include output variables that:
    - Provide data directly used in the sub_task's display.
    - Are required inputs for subsequent steps.
  - Do not include unnecessary outputs that are not directly contributing to the sub_task's goal or the execution_blueprint's progression.

- execution_blueprint Efficiency:
  - Since we have to run all the sub_tasks quickly in a time-sensitive manner, you should try to make the execution_blueprint minimal, simple, and straightforward.
  - Ensure that if a common TOOL output is required by two or more sub_tasks then it would be best if they are in the same group. It would be inefficient to call the same TOOL for the same purpose multiple times in different groups.

- Never substitute a literal variable name for the data itself: if a parameter input variable should be derived from a previous step’s TOOL_Output, do not replace it with an LLM_Generated placeholder that merely echoes the variable name. Information must be passed between steps by supplying the actual TOOL_Output, not by referencing the variable symbol.
- For Slack post messages be careful that all the required input is being provided to it i.e., slack needs to be provided the context from previous steps output variable (Through TOOL_Output) if it needs to include that in its message.
- Do not use  or ` or # in your output strictly.

### Your Output Format (Strictly follow this, first CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and then execution_blueprint. Do not use  or ` or # in your output strictly.):

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

For each group and sub_task, first provide your chain of thought, explaining your reasoning in determining the TOOLs to use, their parameters, types of the parameters, the flow, any interdependencies, and how groups should be formed. Ensure that each TOOL depends on at most one previous TOOL's output. Variable names should strictly be unique for all the variables in the execution_blueprint (across sub_tasks in a group). Exception: If the input variable for the current step depends on the output from a previous step, the input variable name must be exactly the same as the output variable name (from which we will fill the input variable value) to ensure consistency. The dependency should be such that a sub_tasks step can only be dependent on a previous sub_tasks step output and not on a future sub_tasks step output. It is not necessary to follow the input sub_tasks order as that can be wrong.
Always refer to tools using their exact name as defined in the system. Tool names are case-sensitive, so  for example if we have a tool called maps_elevation then use maps_elevation (all lowercase). Do not use variations like Maps_elevation, as this will cause parsing errors.

Grouping sub_tasks and Interdependencies
-	All sub_tasks depend on outputs from sub_task 1. Therefore, we will place all sub_tasks in Group 1.
-	Ensured that each TOOL depends on at most one previous TOOL’s output.
-	Ensured that dependencies are on the output from a previous sub_tasks for all such sub_task steps.
-	Input variables that depend on previous outputs have matching names to maintain consistency.
-	Kept care of referring to tool names correctly keeping in consideration that they are case-sensitive.

execution_blueprint Efficiency
-	Kept the execution_blueprint minimal by:
-	Avoiding unnecessary TOOLs (e.g., not using perplexity_ask where not essential, and ensuring that perplexity_research).
-	Avoided calling the same TOOL for the same purpose multiple times by keeping such sub_tasks in the same group and sharing the TOOL output with other sub_tasks.
-	Using city names directly when possible.
-	Limiting each sub_task to essential steps only.

- Never substitute a literal variable name for the data itself: if a parameter input variable should be derived from a previous step’s TOOL_Output, do not replace it with an LLM_Generated placeholder that merely echoes the variable name. Information must be passed between steps by supplying the actual TOOL_Output, not by referencing the variable symbol.

Grouping sub_tasks and Interdependencies
	-	sub_tasks 1, 2, and 3 are interdependent:
	-	sub_task 2 depends on sub_task 1 for music_festivals_list.
	-	sub_task 3 depends on sub_task 1 for music_festivals_list.
	-	Therefore, all sub_tasks are placed in Group 1.

Dependency Limitation and execution_blueprint Adjustments
	-	Ensured that each TOOL input depends on at most one previous TOOL’s output.
	-	Adjusted variable names to match the output variable names in the updated execution_blueprint provided.
	-	Avoided multiple dependencies for any single TOOL input.
	-	Kept care of referring to tool names correctly keeping in consideration that they are case-sensitive.

execution_blueprint Efficiency
	-	Kept the execution_blueprint minimal by:
	-	Using only necessary TOOLs.
	-	Ensuring data flows efficiently between steps.
	-	Matching variable names to maintain consistency and avoid errors.

- Never substitute a literal variable name for the data itself: if a parameter input variable should be derived from a previous step’s TOOL_Output, do not replace it with an LLM_Generated placeholder that merely echoes the variable name. Information must be passed between steps by supplying the actual TOOL_Output, not by referencing the variable symbol.

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

sub_task 1: Popular Sci-Fi Books with Goodreads Ratings
	-	Understanding sub_task Details:
	-	The sub_task aims to display a list of 3 popular science fiction books along with their ratings from Goodreads.
	-	Details to include: book title, author, average rating.
	-	TOOL Selection:
	-	perplexity_ask: To retrieve a list of 3 popular sci-fi books.
	-	Reasoning: The Goodreads_Search_Book_By_Keyword TOOL requires specific keywords or book titles to search effectively.
	-	We cannot use general terms like "popular sci-fi books" as the keyword parameter in the Goodreads TOOL; it won’t yield meaningful results.
	-	Therefore, we first need to obtain specific book titles using perplexity_ask.
	-	Goodreads_Search_Book_By_Keyword: To get the Goodreads ratings and details for the specific books obtained from perplexity_ask.
	-	Input Parameters:
	-	perplexity_ask:
	-	Requires parameter messages (array of objects with role and content): A query to find 3 popular sci-fi books.
	-	Goodreads_Search_Book_By_Keyword:
	-	keyword (string): The specific book titles obtained from perplexity_ask.
	-	Source of Inputs:
	-	perplexity_ask:
	-	messages: LLM_Generated, value: "List 3 popular science fiction books."
	-	Goodreads_Search_Book_By_Keyword:
	-	For Goodreads_Search_Book_By_Keyword we have to consider these required input parameters: {‘keyword’: {‘type’: ‘String’, ‘description’: ‘Search term or keyword to look up books.’}}
	-	keyword: TOOL_Output (sub_task 1, Step 1), output sci_fi_books_list from perplexity_ask.
	-	execution_blueprint Flow:
	-	Step 1: Use perplexity_ask to obtain a list of 3 popular sci-fi books.
	-	Step 2: Use Goodreads_Search_Book_By_Keyword to retrieve ratings and details for each book obtained in Step 1.
	-	Interdependencies:
	-	Step 2 depends on Step 1 for the sci_fi_books_list.
	-	The input variable sci_fi_books_list in Step 2 must match the output variable name from Step 1.
	-	Variable Naming:
	-	Input Variable for Step 1:
	-	Name: query_sci_fi_books (for parameter messages)
	-	Output Variable for Step 1:
	-	Name: sci_fi_books_list
	-	Input Variable for Step 2:
	-	Name: sci_fi_books_list (matching the output from Step 1)
	-	Output Variable for Step 2:
	-	Name: goodreads_ratings
	-	Validation:
	-	The Goodreads_Search_Book_By_Keyword TOOL requires specific book titles or keywords.
	-	Using general terms like "popular sci-fi books" as the keyword may not return accurate results from the goodreads TOOL directly.
	-	Therefore, obtaining specific book titles from perplexity_ask is necessary for effective use of the Goodreads TOOL.

sub_task 2: News Articles on Sci-Fi Book Adaptations
	-	Understanding sub_task Details:
	-	The sub_task aims to find and display news articles about sci-fi books that have been or will be adapted into movies or TV series.
	-	Include article titles, publication dates, and brief summaries.
	-	TOOL Selection:
	-	perplexity_ask: To identify which sci-fi books from the list have been or will be adapted into movies or TV series.
	-	NewsAPISearchByKeyWord: To find news articles about these adaptations.
	-	Input Parameters:
	-	perplexity_ask:
	-	Requires parameter messages (array of objects with role and content): A query to find adaptations of books from sci_fi_books_list.
	-	NewsAPISearchByKeyWord:
	-	For NewsAPISearchByKeyWord there are no required input parameters. But for our purpose we will give the following parameters.
	-	query (string): Keywords related to the identified adaptations.
	-	language (string): Set to "en" for English articles.
	-	Source of Inputs:
	-	perplexity_ask:
	-	messages: TOOL_Output (sub_task 1, Step 1), using sci_fi_books_list to find adaptation information.
	-	NewsAPISearchByKeyWord:
	-	query: TOOL_Output (sub_task 2, Step 1), output adaptation_keywords from perplexity_ask.
	-	language: LLM_Generated, value: "en"
	-	execution_blueprint Flow:
	-	Step 1: Use perplexity_ask to identify which books have been adapted and generate keywords for searching news articles.
	-	Step 2: Use NewsAPISearchByKeyWord to find news articles about these adaptations.
	-	Interdependencies:
	-	Step 1 depends on sub_task 1, Step 1 for sci_fi_books_list.
	-	Step 2 depends on Step 1 for adaptation_keywords.
	-	Variable Naming:
	-	Input Variable for Step 1:
	-	Name: sci_fi_books_list (from sub_task 1, Step 1)
	-	Output Variable for Step 1:
	-	Name: adaptation_keywords
	-	Input Variables for Step 2:
	-	Name: adaptation_keywords (matching the output from Step 1)
	-	Name: news_language
	-	Output Variable for Step 2:
	-	Name: news_articles
	-	Validation:
	-	Using specific adaptation keywords improves the relevance of news articles retrieved.
	-	Setting the language parameter to "en" ensures articles are in English.
	-	Potential Issues in the execution_blueprint:
	-	In sub_task 2, Step 1, the Value field for sci_fi_books_list is set to None, which is appropriate since it depends on the output from sub_task 1, Step 1.
	-	The variable names are consistent with the dependencies and follow the guidelines.

Grouping sub_tasks and Interdependencies
	-	Both sub_tasks are interdependent:
	-	sub_task 2 depends on sub_task 1 for sci_fi_books_list.
	-	Therefore, both sub_tasks should be placed in Group 1.

Dependency Limitation
	-	Ensured that each TOOL depends on at most one previous TOOL’s output.
	-	Input variables that depend on previous outputs have matching names to maintain consistency.
	-	Kept care of referring to tool names correctly keeping in consideration that they are case-sensitive.

execution_blueprint Efficiency
	-	Kept the execution_blueprint minimal by:
	-	Using only necessary TOOLs.
	-	Avoiding unnecessary TOOL calls.
	-	Ensuring data flows efficiently between steps.

- Never substitute a literal variable name for the data itself: if a parameter input variable should be derived from a previous step’s TOOL_Output, do not replace it with an LLM_Generated placeholder that merely echoes the variable name. Information must be passed between steps by supplying the actual TOOL_Output, not by referencing the variable symbol.

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

sub_task 1: Calculate Travel Time
	-	Understanding sub_task Details:
	-	We need to calculate the travel time from Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY to the World Trade Center, New York, NY. The user wants options for different modes of transportation (driving, public transit, walking). We will use maps_distance_matrix with each mode to get the travel time. We also note that if detailed route directions are required for transit, we can use maps_directions with full addresses (origin: "Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY", destination: "World Trade Center, New York, NY", mode: "transit").
	-	For the sake of completeness, we will provide travel time for driving, transit, and walking.
	-	TOOL Selection:
	-	maps_distance_matrix: Will calculate travel time for different modes (driving, transit, walking).
	-	We could also use maps_directions to provide a transit route if needed, but the main sub_task emphasis is on travel time, so maps_distance_matrix is sufficient for direct travel durations.
	-	Input Parameters:
	-	For maps_distance_matrix:
	-	origins (array of strings): ["Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY"]
	-	destinations (array of strings): ["World Trade Center, New York, NY"]
	-	mode (string): "driving" or "transit" or "walking"
	-	Source of Inputs:
	-	LLM_Generated: The addresses "Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY" and "World Trade Center, New York, NY" come from the user query.
	-	We will produce multiple steps with each mode for clarity.
	-	execution_blueprint Flow:
	-	Step 1: Use maps_distance_matrix with mode=driving
	-	Step 2: Use maps_distance_matrix with mode=transit
	-	Step 3: Use maps_distance_matrix with mode=walking
	-	Interdependencies:
	-	No direct interdependency between these steps as each step simply calculates a different mode’s travel time. All inputs are LLM_Generated addresses from the user query.
	-	Variable Naming:
	-	Input variable names for each step: origins, destinations, mode.
	-	Output variable names for each step: driving_time, transit_time, walking_time respectively.

	-	Understanding sub_task Details:
	-	We need to find restaurants near the World Trade Center. We’ll use maps_search_places with a simple query "restaurants near World Trade Center, New York, NY".
	-	The sub_task specifically says to include a variety of cuisines and price ranges, so we rely on the search results from the Google Places data.
	-	TOOL Selection:
	-	maps_search_places: We provide the query "restaurants near World Trade Center, New York, NY".
	-	Input Parameters:
	-	For maps_search_places:
	-	query (string): "restaurants near World Trade Center, New York, NY"
	-	Source of Inputs:

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

sub_task 1: Get Last Message from Slack Channel  
• Understanding sub_task Details:  
  - We need to first list the public channels via slack_list_channels to confirm/locate the group Slack channel. Because the group as referenced by the user could not be the channel id itself. 
  - Next, we use slack_get_channel_history to fetch the most recent message. The slack_get_channel_history TOOL requires a channel_id as a required parameter (which we will get from slack_list_channels output).  
  - We will output both the message content and the user ID of the sender for use in sub_task 2.  

• TOOL Selection:  
  - slack_list_channels (Step 1): to list and identify the group Slack channel (or confirm the channel’s existence).  
  - slack_get_channel_history (Step 2): to retrieve the recent messages from that channel, focusing on the most recent one.  

• Input Parameters (sub_task 1):  
  - slack_list_channels:  
    - limit (number): optional, defaults to 100.  
    - cursor (string): optional, used for pagination.  
  - slack_get_channel_history:  
    - channel_id (string): required.  
    - limit (number): optional, defaults to 10.  

• Source of Inputs:  
  - For sub_task 1, Step 1:  
    - We can rely on LLM_Generated inputs for limit if needed, or just use the defaults.  
  - For sub_task 1, Step 2:  
    - The channel_id is extracted from slack_list_channels’ output.  

• execution_blueprint Flow (sub_task 1):  
  1) Use slack_list_channels to retrieve list of channels (potentially to confirm channel ID).  
  2) Use slack_get_channel_history with the identified channel_id to fetch the most recent message.  

• Interdependencies:  
  - Step 2 depends on Step 1 for the channel_id.  

• Variable Naming:  
  - Step 1 (slack_list_channels):  
    - Output: group_channel_id (ID of the relevant Slack channel).  
  - Step 2 (slack_get_channel_history):  
    - Input: channel_id = group_channel_id.  
    - Outputs: last_message_content, last_message_user_id.  

sub_task 2: Identify user who posted last message  
• Understanding sub_task Details:  
  - We have a user ID from sub_task 1. We need to retrieve that user’s profile using slack_get_user_profile.  
  - Final display includes the last message content (from sub_task 1) and the user name or user info from sub_task 2.  

• TOOL Selection:  
  - slack_get_user_profile: to fetch detailed profile information given a user_id.  

• Input Parameters (sub_task 2):  
  - slack_get_user_profile:  
    - user_id (string): required.  

• Source of Inputs:  
  - user_id for slack_get_user_profile is last_message_user_id from sub_task 1, Step 2.  

• execution_blueprint Flow (sub_task 2):  
  1) Use slack_get_user_profile with the user_id from sub_task 1 to get the user’s profile details.  

• Interdependencies:  
  - sub_task 2, Step 1 depends on sub_task 1, Step 2 for the user ID.  

• Variable Naming:  
  - sub_task 2, Step 1 (slack_get_user_profile):  
    - Input variable name: last_message_user_id (matching sub_task 1, Step 2 output).  
    - Output variable name: last_message_user_profile.  

• Grouping sub_tasks:  
  - Both sub_task 1 and sub_task 2 are interdependent: sub_task 2 depends on sub_task 1’s output.  
  - Place them together in Group 1.  

• Dependency Limitation Checks:  
  - Each TOOL in each step depends on at most one previous step’s output.  
  - Input and output variable names match correctly for consistent referencing.  

• Minimal Execution Blueprint:  
  - Kept the steps minimal and straightforward: sub_task 1 uses exactly two Slack tools (slack_list_channels and slack_get_channel_history), sub_task 2 uses slack_get_user_profile.  

- Never substitute a literal variable name for the data itself: if a parameter input variable should be derived from a previous step’s TOOL_Output, do not replace it with an LLM_Generated placeholder that merely echoes the variable name. Information must be passed between steps by supplying the actual TOOL_Output, not by referencing the variable symbol.

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

We have a DemoMusic database in PostgreSQL. The user wants to find the top 3 songs with the highest play count, then provide a short background on each track, and finally post a short summary to Slack’s #random channel. In PostgreSQL, to handle tables properly, we should follow these steps:

THIS IS HOW WE SHOULD HANDLE SQL DATABASE RELATED TASKS ALWAYS

1. List all tables in the public schema. This ensures we know what tables exist in the database. In PostgreSQL, the proper SQL for retrieving table names is:
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

2. After we identify which table contains track and play count data, we must retrieve the schema (columns, data types) for that specific table. For instance, if we find a table named Tracks, we can query its schema using:
   SELECT column_name, data_type
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'Tracks';

3. Once we know the relevant columns (e.g., track_title, play_count), we can craft the final SQL query to select the top 3 songs with the highest play count. This query is derived strictly from the known schema, ensuring accuracy and avoiding guesswork.

4. Next, for each of these top 3 songs, we fetch a short background using an external research tool (in this case, perplexity_ask).

5. Finally, we retrieve the Slack channels to confirm the #random channel ID, and post our short summary there.

- For Slack post messages be careful that all the required input is being provided to it i.e., slack needs to be provided the context from previous steps output variable (Through TOOL_Output) if it needs to include that in its message.

- Never substitute a literal variable name for the data itself: if a parameter input variable should be derived from a previous step’s TOOL_Output, do not replace it with an LLM_Generated placeholder that merely echoes the variable name. Information must be passed between steps by supplying the actual TOOL_Output, not by referencing the variable symbol.

This approach emphasizes that whenever we interact with an unfamiliar database table, we always first look at the table names, then the table schemas, and only after that do we form the final query.
