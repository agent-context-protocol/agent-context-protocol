Instructions:
Please write one section of the report at a time, based on the provided panel step output.

Important Formatting & Professionalism Guidelines:

- The report should always begin with a title at the start, before the introduction section. But remember that we are writing one section at a time, so only the first time you need to do this, and not again and again.
- The final PDF report should have a professional look with reduced line spacing and consistent font sizes. Headings should be distinct and readable, but not excessively large. Use a clean, professional serif font (e.g., "Georgia" or "Times New Roman") for body text and a clean, professional sans-serif font (e.g., "Helvetica Neue") for headings.
- The references, bullet points, and main text should be harmonized in terms of font size and spacing to ensure a consistent, professional look throughout the report.
- The table should be white in color (white background) with contrasting text and borders for a professional look. In LaTeX, by default, tables have a white background. Ensure you use professional formatting (e.g., booktabs package for clean lines) and appropriate font choices.
- Tables must fit within page boundaries. Always use the longtable environment for all tables so that if the content is too large to fit on one page, the table will automatically continue onto the next page. If the content is too wide, prefer vertical elongation or adjust column widths rather than cutting off horizontally. Include \usepackage{longtable} in the preamble.
- Tables should include vertical lines between columns for better readability. Content in tables should be left-aligned by default and have sufficient spacing between rows for clarity. Adjust row spacing using commands like \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}.
- Figures and tables must be accompanied by captions. Captions should be italicized, slightly smaller in font size than the body text, and centered beneath the figure/table. Each figure and table should be numbered (e.g., "Figure 1:" or "Table 1:"), and the text must refer to them explicitly (e.g., "As shown in Figure 1..." or "See Table 1 below...") to maintain a cohesive narrative. Always integrate figures and tables within the relevant subsection’s narrative; do not create a separate standalone subsection just for a figure.
- Bullet points must use proper LaTeX environments such as itemize for clarity. Do not use `-` or other symbols to denote list items. Each item in the bullet list must appear on a new line.
- References should always be formatted as hyperlinked text using the hyperref package, and long URLs must wrap correctly without exceeding page margins. Replace visible URLs with descriptive text (e.g., "Overview of Renewable Energy Sources").
- If any subsection is related to visual data (figures, charts, or tables), do not create a new separate subsection for that figure/table. Instead, integrate the figure/table and its explanation directly within the previous subsection’s narrative. Always properly reference the figure/table in the narrative before it appears.
- Excessive vertical spacing (e.g., between the title and Section 1) should be avoided. Use LaTeX preamble commands such as \setlength{\droptitle} or the titlesec package to optimize vertical spacing.
- The styling changes and numbering of figures/tables must be followed consistently throughout the report. The examples provided at the end are illustrative; the instructions here are binding for the entire report.
- For tables and figures, you need to keep a global count and accordingly tag them with the appropriate table number and figure number. Do not start a new table and figure numbering for each section.
- Do not include a conclusion or summary paragraph in each section. The conclusion section will be included at the end of the entire report. Moroever do not create a new subsection for summary tables or visualization plots.
- You have to strictly follow LaTeX formatting for everything and not get confused by HTML-formatted inputs. Inputs in `** **` or `-` are incorrect and must be properly converted to valid LaTeX formats such as \textbf{} and \item.
- Do not add a \end{document} at the end anywhere, always. That will be done manually later.

Instructions for Each Iteration:

1. Input and Output Context:
   - You will be provided with:
     - The user query for the report generation ({user_query})
     - Section Details ({section_details}) that outline the desired structure of the report
     - The current panel step output ({panel_steps}), which may represent a potential section or part of a section
     - The report written so far ({report_so_far})

   Your job is to produce one report section at a time, integrating the provided panel step content if it is relevant and does not duplicate previously included material.

2. Chain of Thought Section:
   - Before writing the report section, produce a $$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$ block where you reason about whether to use the current panel step.
   - Mention the selected panel in the Chain of Thought (e.g., "Selected Panel for Current Section: Panel X").
   - Explain why you are using or skipping the panel. If you use it, explain how it fits logically into the report.
   - Confirm in your Chain of Thought that you will integrate the formatting and styling improvements (such as proper fonts, spacing, white background tables with contrasting text and borders, left-aligned and spacious table content with vertical lines, centered figure/table captions, properly formatted bullet points, professional referencing with hyperlinked text) and always use longtable for tables if needed.
   - Confirm that if the table content is large, you will consider using longtable to allow the table to flow to the next page rather than getting cut off, ensuring vertical elongation instead of horizontal cutting.
   - Confirm that you will integrate figures and tables within the narrative, referencing them properly before they appear and not placing them in separate standalone subsections. Each section written should be well integrated into the overall report.
   - In your Chain of Thought, always keep track of how many tables and figures have appeared before in the report. If in the current section there is any table or figure, assign the next appropriate number.
   - Do not include a conclusion or summary paragraph in each section. The conclusion will be included only at the end of the entire report.
   - Moroever do not create a new subsection for summary tables or visualization plots.
   - Strictly follow LaTeX formatting for everything. Inputs like `** **` or `-` must be converted to \textbf{} or \item.
   - Do not add a \end{document} at the end anywhere.

   Important Note for Introduction:
   - For the introduction section, always use the Section Details as the authoritative source for the structure of the report. Ignore any potentially conflicting structure suggested by the panel content.
   - Confirm in your Chain of Thought that you will follow the Section Details, maintain the improved formatting and referencing style, and ensure any figures or tables introduced are properly referenced and integrated into the narrative.

3. Writing the Report Section:
   - Produce a $$REPORT_SECTION$$ block containing the new section of the report in LaTeX form.
   - At the very beginning of the entire report (in the first iteration), include a LaTeX preamble that sets up fonts, spacing, and other styling once. Do not repeat the preamble in subsequent sections.
   - Use \section{}, \subsection{}, and normal LaTeX paragraphs to structure the report instead of HTML tags. We have to strictly follow LaTeX formatting for everything and not get confused by HTML-formatted inputs.
   - Inputs in `** **` or `-` are not the correct way to format bold text or lists in LaTeX. Always use proper LaTeX environments, such as \textbf{} for bold text and itemize for lists.
   - Ensure the text is well-spaced and uses consistent fonts throughout. Avoid unnecessary vertical spacing, especially between the title and the first section.
   - When including tables or figures:
     - Refer to them in the text before displaying them.
     - Use the longtable environment for all tables. If the table is long, longtable will allow it to continue across pages.
     - Include visible vertical and horizontal cell borders for clarity. Ensure sufficient row spacing using:
       \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
       \usepackage{array, longtable}
       \newcolumntype{L}[1]{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{#1}}
     - Include captions with \caption{\textit{...}}
     - Ensure tables have a white background, contrasting text, and visible borders for a professional look. Bold text for headers if needed.
     - For figures, ensure they are properly referenced in the text, integrated in the same subsection, and do not form a standalone subsection. Use consistent numbering and ensure figures have adequate explanatory captions.
   - Bullet points must use the itemize environment.
   - For references, always ensure hyperlinks wrap properly using the hyperref package. Replace visible URLs with descriptive hyperlink text.
   - After writing the section content, include a $$REFERENCES$$ block at the end of the report:
     - For each section, create a subsection heading for references, e.g., \subsection*{Section X: [Section Title]}
     - List references relevant to that section using descriptive hyperlinks.
     - Do not merge references from different sections.
   
   Format for Report Section (LaTeX skeleton):
   $$REPORT_SECTION$$

   % Preamble only included once at the start of the entire report if this is the first section

   \section{Section {X}: [Section Title]}
   % Content

   \subsection{Subsection {X.Y}: [Subsection Title]}
   % Content and tables/figures integrated in narrative

   \section{Section {X+1}: [Section Title]}
   % Content

   \subsection{Subsection {X+1.Y}: [Subsection Title]}
   % Content and tables/figures integrated in narrative

   $$REFERENCES$$
   \subsection*{Section {X}: [Section Title]}
   % References here

   \subsection*{Section {X+1}: [Section Title]}
   % References here

4. Conclusion Section:
   - When the panel output is "Conclusion," write a comprehensive conclusion summarizing the entire report using the content written so far.
   - Follow the same referencing style in the conclusion. If no references are cited, include an empty references subsection.
   - Avoid including a summary or conclusion in individual sections, only in the final conclusion.

5. References Section Handling:
   - Each section must have its own $$REFERENCES$$ block.
   - Use hyperref for all references.

6. Termination Condition:
   - When all sections are processed, output $$TERMINATE$$ in the final iteration.
   - Include a $$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$ block before $$TERMINATE$$ confirming all panels processed.

7. Avoiding Confusion:
   - Do not confuse panel step outputs with the report itself.

8. No Mention of External Agents:
   - Do not attribute tables or figures to any agent.

Additional Guidelines:
- Process panels in sequence. If irrelevant, produce empty $$REPORT_SECTION$$ and references structure.
- For introduction, follow Section Details strictly. For conclusion, summarize entire report.

- Do not add \end{document} at the end.

\section{Section 1: Introduction to Renewable Energy and Carbon Emissions}
Renewable energy sources—such as solar and wind—have emerged as critical drivers in the global effort to combat climate change. Over the past decade, improvements in technology, declining costs, and supportive policies have facilitated a rapid increase in the adoption of these cleaner energy sources. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy provides a sustainable means of electricity generation without significantly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

Carbon emissions, primarily in the form of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), are central to climate change discussions. Conventional energy generation methods have relied heavily on coal, oil, and natural gas, resulting in substantial emissions contributing to global warming and environmental degradation. By analyzing how the expansion of solar and wind power has influenced carbon emission levels, we can better understand the role of renewable energy in building a more sustainable future.

Following this introduction, the report will present a historical context of energy use, examine growth trends in renewable energy from 2014 to 2023, explore the development of solar and wind power, and assess their collective impact on carbon emissions. Additionally, it will consider regional patterns, policy frameworks, and economic factors shaping the global renewable energy landscape.

\section{Section 2: Historical Context of Energy Use}
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:fossil_consumption}, historical reliance on fossil fuels formed a baseline for today’s energy production challenges.

\end{figure}

To model the transition to renewable energy, we often analyze probabilistic behavior. Optimization techniques such as minimizing the cross-entropy loss are critical in forecasting models.
