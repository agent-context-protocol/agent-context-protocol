Your Current Role is: WORKFLOW_CREATION_REQUEST

### Your Task:

1. Determine the APIs:
   - For each panel, decide which APIs should be used. You are expected to select at least two APIs per panel. Frequently used APIs, such as Perplexity, can always be considered, but you can also use other relevant APIs based on the panel's description.

2. Explain Your Chain of Thought:
   Before creating the workflow, explain your reasoning regarding how you are thinking about the workflow. Consider the following:

   - API Selection:
     - Which APIs to choose for each panel.

   - Input Parameters:
     - What are the input parameters of the APIs being used? What is the type of data each input parameter expects?

   - Source of Inputs:
     - What would be the source for these parameters (LLM_Generated or API_Output)? Use LLM_Generated only if we are inferring something from the query or the API description. Do not use your own knowledge; rather, use Perplexity to retrieve information.

   - Workflow Flow:
     - What should be the flow for each of the panels? Since we have to run all the panels quickly in a time-sensitive manner, we should try to make the workflow minimal, simple, and straightforward. 

   - Interdependencies:
     - What might be interdependencies between steps of the same panel and different panels? Interdependencies mean that a panel's input variable depends on a previous step, which might be from the same panel or a different one.
     - Important: If the input variable for the current step depends on the output from a previous step, the input variable name must be exactly the same as the output variable name (from which we will fill the input variable value) to ensure consistency.
     - Example for Issue 1:
       - Correct:
         - Output Variable from Step 1: `location_data`
         - Input Variable for Step 2:
           - Name: `location_data` (matches the output variable name)
           - Source: `API_Output (Panel 1, Step 1)`
       - Incorrect:
         - Output Variable from Step 1: `location_data`
         - Input Variable for Step 2:
           - Name: `input_location` (different name)
           - Source: `API_Output (Panel 1, Step 1)`

   - Grouping Panels:
     - Based on the interdependencies, which panels should be in the same groups? If there is interdependency between panels, then they should be in the same group.

   - Dependency Limitation:
     - Ensure that each API depends on at most one previous API's output. If an API depends on outputs from more than one API, do not consider that workflow.

3. API Input Requirements:
   - Be sure to check and understand the API input requirements very carefully and their data types before proceeding to use them.

4. Order of Execution and Workflow Creation:
   - Ensure that the APIs are executed in the correct order to satisfy input requirements. For example, if the Weather API needs data, Perplexity may need to run first to gather that data.
   - The workflow must strictly follow the API's requirements, ensuring that inputs, outputs, and the sequence of steps are all based on the exact API description.
   - Follow the input arguments of each API very carefully and do not add or modify any of the API parameters unless explicitly allowed by the API documentation.

5. Group Panels Based on Cross Dependencies:
   - Identify if there are cross-panel dependencies where one panel's data is needed for another panel. If so, group these panels together and ensure the workflows reflect these dependencies.
   - Only panels with interdependencies should be placed in the same group, and panels that do not depend on each other must be strictly placed in different groups.

6. Handle API Dependencies:
   - When there's a dependency between steps or panels, ensure the step whose output will be used in other steps provides the correct data.
   - Structure the inputs according to API specifications to guarantee the API produces the necessary output for the dependent step.

7. Keep the Workflow Minimal:
   - Since we need to run the whole workflow quickly, we should only perform important steps to build the panels.
   - Always choose the most straightforward, simple, and minimal workflow for each panel.



### Important Note:

- Cross-Check Inputs and Outputs:
  - Always cross-check the inputs and outputs with the API description.
  - Never assume additional inputs or outputs beyond what is specified in the API documentation.

- Strict Adherence to API Parameters:
  - Strictly follow the input arguments required by each API and ensure the workflows adhere to the specific API parameters without altering them.

- Output Format:
  - Always only output the CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and WORKFLOW without any other details before or after.
  - Follow the output format precisely, first explaining the Chain of Thought under CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and then detailing the workflow under WORKFLOW.

- Grouping Panels:
  - Do not put two panels in the same group if there is no interdependency between them. Strictly put them in different groups.

- Variable Naming:
  - Variable names should strictly be unique for all variables in the workflow (across panels in a group).
  - Exception: If the input variable for the current step depends on the output from a previous step, the input variable name must be exactly the same as the output variable name to ensure consistency.
  - Example for Issue 1:
    - Correct:
      - Output Variable from Step 1: `data_result`
      - Input Variable for Step 2:
        - Name: `data_result` (matches the output variable name)
        - Source: `API_Output (Panel X, Step Y)`
    - Incorrect:
      - Output Variable from Step 1: `data_result`
      - Input Variable for Step 2:
        - Name: `result_data` (different name)
        - Source: `API_Output (Panel X, Step Y)`

- Source Field of Input Variables:
  - In the Source field of input variables, you have two options:
    1. LLM_Generated:
       - Use when the variable can be directly inferred from the user's query or API description or is an optional parameter that doesn't affect the core API output, only its representation or formatting.
       - Do not use your own knowledge about something to input values; rather, use Perplexity to retrieve information.
       - Must Provide Value:
         - When the Source is LLM_Generated, you must provide a Value based on the user's query or API descriptions.
       - Cannot Reference Other Outputs:
         - LLM_Generated variables cannot reference or depend on other output variables. If they do, the Source should be API_Output.
       - Example for Issue 3:
         - Correct:
           - Input Variable:
             - Name: `search_query`
             - Source: `LLM_Generated`
             - Value: `"Best vacation spots in India"`
         - Incorrect:
           - Input Variable:
             - Name: `search_query`
             - Source: `LLM_Generated`
             - Value: `Result from previous step output_variable`

    2. API_Output (Panel X, Step X):
       - Use when the variable depends on the output of a previous API call.
       - Specify the exact panel and step number (e.g., "API_Output (Panel 1, Step 2)").
       - Since interdependent panels are in the same group, the format cannot include the group (e.g., do not use "API_Output (Group 1, Panel 1, Step 2)").

- Input Variables Structure:
  - For input variables, include the following keys:
    - Name: Unique variable name across panels in a group.
    - Parameter: Specifies the exact parameter name as required by the API documentation.
    - Type: Expected data type of the parameter based on the API documentation.
    - Source: LLM_Generated or API_Output (Panel X, Step X).
    - Description: Describes the variable and how you intend to use it.
    - Value: If the source is LLM_Generated, provide the value generated based on the user query and what the step in the panel is handling. If the source is API_Output, the Value should be None.

- Output Variables Usage:
  - Only include output variables that:
    - Provide data directly used in the panel's display.
    - Are required inputs for subsequent steps.
  - Do not include unnecessary outputs that are not directly contributing to the panel's goal or the workflow's progression.

- Workflow Efficiency:
  - Since we have to run all the panels quickly in a time-sensitive manner, you should try to make the workflow minimal, simple, and straightforward.

- Do not use  in your output strictly.

  - The input variable `nyc_coordinates` in Step 2 must match the output variable name from Step 1.

- Variable Naming:
  - Input variable name for Step 1: `query_nyc_coordinates`
  - Output variable for Step 1: `nyc_coordinates`.
  - Input variable name for Step 2: `nyc_coordinates` (matching the output variable name), `forecast_dates`.
  - Output variable name for Step 2: `weather_forecast`

Grouping Panels and Interdependencies

- Panel 1 and Panel 2 do not have interdependencies between them.
- Therefore, they should be placed in different groups:
  - Panel 1 is in Group 1.
  - Panel 2 is in Group 2.

Dependency Limitation

- Ensured that each API depends on at most one previous API's output.
- All input variables that depend on previous outputs have matching names to maintain consistency.

Workflow Efficiency

- Kept the workflow minimal by:
  - Using only necessary APIs.
  - Avoiding unnecessary steps like additional Perplexity calls.
  - Extracting dates directly from the user's query without additional processing.

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

Panel 1: News in the Netherlands

- API Selection:
  - The user's query is "What is the news in Netherlands?"
  - We can directly use the NewsAPISearchByKeyWord API to fetch news articles related to the Netherlands.
  - Perplexity is not necessary here since we can use the country name directly as the search query.
  - We should avoid using the `region` parameter in the NewsAPI if we are unsure about the exact region code or if it might limit the results in unintended ways.

- Input Parameters:
  - NewsAPISearchByKeyWord:
    - `query` (string): The keyword or phrase to search for in news articles.
    - `language` (string): The language of the news articles. This is optional but can be set to "en" for English.
    - `region` (string): The region or country code. Since we are not sure about the correct region code for the Netherlands in the API, it's best to omit this parameter to ensure we don't miss relevant articles.

- Source of Inputs:
  - `query`: LLM_Generated, value `"Netherlands"`, directly extracted from the user's query.
  - `language`: LLM_Generated, value `"en"`, assuming the user wants news articles in English.
  - We will not use the `region` parameter to avoid potential issues with incorrect or restrictive region codes.

- Workflow Flow:
  - Step 1: Use NewsAPISearchByKeyWord to fetch recent news articles about the Netherlands using the keyword and language parameters.

- Interdependencies:
  - As this is a single-step workflow, there are no interdependencies with other steps or panels.

- Variable Naming:
  - Input Variables:
    - `news_query` (for the `query` parameter)
    - `news_language` (for the `language` parameter)
  - Output Variables:
    - `news_articles`

- Grouping Panels and Interdependencies:
  - Since there's only one panel, it will be placed in Group 1.
  - There are no dependencies on other panels.

- Dependency Limitation:
  - The API call does not depend on any previous API outputs.

- Workflow Efficiency:
  - The workflow is minimal and straightforward, using only one API call.
  - By avoiding unnecessary parameters like `region`, we reduce the risk of errors and ensure we retrieve the most comprehensive set of news articles.
