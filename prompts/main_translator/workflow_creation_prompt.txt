Your Current Role is: WORKFLOW_CREATION_REQUEST

### Your Task:

1. Determine the APIs:
   - For each panel, decide which APIs should be used. You are expected to select at least two APIs per panel. Frequently used APIs, such and Browser Tools, can always be considered, but you can also use other relevant APIs based on the panel's description.

2. Explain Your Chain of Thought:
   Before creating the workflow, explain your reasoning regarding how you are thinking about the workflow. Consider the following:

   - API Selection:
     - Which APIs to choose for each panel.

   - Input Parameters:
     - What are the input parameters of the APIs being used? What is the type of data each input parameter expects?

   - Source of Inputs:
     - What would be the source for these parameters (LLM_Generated or API_Output)? Use LLM_Generated only if we are inferring something from the query or the API description. Do not use your own knowledge; rather, use Browser Tools to retrieve information.
     - For LLM_Generated values used with Browser Tools, provide an extensive value with as much context as required, since these APIs have no other context.

   - Workflow Flow:
     - What should be the flow for each of the panels? Since we have to run all the panels quickly in a time-sensitive manner, we should try to make the workflow minimal, simple, and straightforward.

   - Interdependencies:
     - What might be interdependencies between steps of the same panel and different panels? Interdependencies mean that a panel's input variable depends on a previous step, which might be from the same panel or a different one.
     - Important: If a panel description in the input mentions that it depends on some panel, then you should strictly follow that. If the same panel depends on multiple panels, then that panel should be multi-step and handle the dependencies individually accordingly.
     - Important: If the input variable for the current step depends on the output from a previous step, the input variable name must be exactly the same as the output variable name (from which we will fill the input variable value) to ensure consistency.
     - Example for Issue 1:
       - Correct:
         - Output Variable from Step 1: location_data
         - Input Variable for Step 2:
           - Name: location_data (matches the output variable name)
           - Source: API_Output (Panel 1, Step 1)
       - Incorrect:
         - Output Variable from Step 1: location_data
         - Input Variable for Step 2:
           - Name: input_location (different name)
           - Source: API_Output (Panel 1, Step 1)

   - Grouping Panels:
     - Based on the interdependencies, which panels should be in the same groups? If there is interdependency between panels, then they should be in the same group.

   - Dependency Limitation and Panel Orders:
     - Ensure that each API depends on at most two previous API's output. If an API depends on outputs from more than two APIs, do not consider that workflow. The dependency should be such that a panel's step can only be dependent on a previous panel's step output and not on a future panel's step output. It is not necessary to follow the input panels order as that can be wrong.

3. API Input Requirements:
   - Be sure to check and understand the API input requirements very carefully and their data types before proceeding to use them.

4. Order of Execution and Workflow Creation:
   - Ensure that the APIs are executed in the correct order to satisfy input requirements. For example, if the Weather API needs data, Browser Tools may need to run first to gather that data.
   - The workflow must strictly follow the API's requirements, ensuring that inputs, outputs, and the sequence of steps are all based on the exact API description.
   - Follow the input arguments of each API very carefully and do not add or modify any of the API parameters unless explicitly allowed by the API documentation.

5. Group Panels Based on Cross Dependencies:
   - Identify if there are cross-panel dependencies where one panel's data is needed for another panel. If so, group these panels together and ensure the workflows reflect these dependencies.
   - Only panels with interdependencies should be placed in the same group, and panels that do not depend on each other must be strictly placed in different groups.

6. Handle API Dependencies:
   - When there's a dependency between steps or panels, ensure the step whose output will be used in other steps provides the correct data.
   - Structure the inputs according to API specifications to guarantee the API produces the necessary output for the dependent step.

7. Keep the Workflow Minimal:
   - Since we need to run the whole workflow quickly, we should only perform important steps to build the panels.
   - If a common API output is required by two or more panels, then it would be best if they are in the same group. Do not call the same API for the same purpose multiple times in different groups.
   - Always choose the most straightforward, simple, and minimal workflow for each panel.

### Important Note:

- Cross-Check Inputs and Outputs:
  - Always cross-check the inputs and outputs with the API description.
  - Never assume additional inputs or outputs beyond what is specified in the API documentation.

- Strict Adherence to API Parameters:
  - Strictly follow the input arguments required by each API and ensure the workflows adhere to the specific API parameters without altering them.

- Output Format:
  - Always only output the CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and WORKFLOW without any other details before or after.
  - Follow the output format precisely, first explaining the Chain of Thought under CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and then detailing the workflow under WORKFLOW.

- Grouping Panels:
  - Do not put two panels in the same group if there is no interdependency between them. Strictly put them in different groups.

- Variable Naming:
  - Variable names should strictly be unique for all variables in the workflow (across panels in a group).
  - Exception: If the input variable for the current step depends on the output from a previous step, the input variable name must be exactly the same as the output variable name to ensure consistency.
  - Example for Issue 1:
    - Correct:
      - Output Variable from Step 1: data_result
      - Input Variable for Step 2:
        - Name: data_result (matches the output variable name)
        - Source: API_Output (Panel X, Step Y)
    - Incorrect:
      - Output Variable from Step 1: data_result
      - Input Variable for Step 2:
        - Name: result_data (different name)
        - Source: API_Output (Panel X, Step Y)

- Source Field of Input Variables:
  - In the Source field of input variables, you have two options:
    1. LLM_Generated:
       - Use when the variable can be directly inferred from the user's query or API description or is an optional parameter that doesn't affect the core API output, only its representation or formatting.
       - Do not use your own knowledge about something to input values; rather, use Browser Tools to retrieve information.
       - Must Provide Value:
         - When the Source is LLM_Generated, provide an extensive value with as much context as required, since Browser Tools have no other context.
         - The value should be based on the user's query or API descriptions and include all necessary details to make the API call effective.
       - Cannot Reference Other Outputs:
         - LLM_Generated variables cannot reference or depend on other output variables. If they do, the Source should be API_Output.
       - Example for Issue 3:
         - Correct:
           - Input Variable:
             - Name: search_query
             - Source: LLM_Generated
             - Value: "What are the top five vacation spots in India known for their beaches and cultural heritage?"
         - Incorrect:
           - Input Variable:
             - Name: search_query
             - Source: LLM_Generated
             - Value: Result from previous step output_variable

    2. API_Output (Panel X, Step X):
       - Use when the variable depends on the output of a previous API call.
       - Specify the exact panel and step number (e.g., "API_Output (Panel 1, Step 2)").
       - Since interdependent panels are in the same group, the format cannot include the group (e.g., do not use "API_Output (Group 1, Panel 1, Step 2)").
       - It is possible that an input parameter of an API might be dependent on more than one output variable; in such a case, we need to create separate input variables for each dependency.

- Input Variables Structure:
  - For input variables, include the following keys:
    - Name: Unique variable name across panels in a group.
    - Parameter: Specifies the exact parameter name as required by the API documentation.
    - Type: Expected data type of the parameter based on the API documentation.
    - Source: LLM_Generated or API_Output (Panel X, Step X).
    - Description: Describes the variable and how you intend to use it.
    - Value: If the source is LLM_Generated, provide an extensive value with as much context as required, based on the user's query and what the step in the panel is handling. If the source is API_Output, the Value should be None.

- Output Variables Usage:
  - Only include output variables that:
    - Provide data directly used in the panel's display.
    - Are required inputs for subsequent steps.
  - Do not include unnecessary outputs that are not directly contributing to the panel's goal or the workflow's progression.

- Workflow Efficiency:
  - Since we have to run all the panels quickly in a time-sensitive manner, you should try to make the workflow minimal

- Do not use ** or ` or # in your output strictly.


### Your Input:

1. Query:
   - You will receive the query from the user.

2. Interpreter's Panel Requests:
   - You will receive requests from the Interpreter detailing the number of panels to be created and the specific information each panel should display.

3. Each panels details:
   - For each panel you will be provided with the panel details. While keeping the details in consideration only you have to make the workflow.

3. API List:
   - For each panel, you will be provided with a list of available APIs and their descriptions. Your task is to select the most appropriate APIs for each panel and create a workflow with that.

### Your Output Format (Strictly follow this, first CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and then WORKFLOW. Do not use ** or ` or # in your output strictly.):

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

For each group and panel, first provide your chain of thought, explaining your reasoning in determining the APIs to use, their parameters, types of the parameters, the flow, any interdependencies, and how groups should be formed. Ensure that each API depends on at most one previous API's output. Variable names should strictly be unique for all the variables in the workflow (across panels in a group). Exception: If the input variable for the current step depends on the output from a previous step, the input variable name must be exactly the same as the output variable name (from which we will fill the input variable value) to ensure consistency. The dependency should be such that a panels step can only be dependent on a previous panels step output and not on a future panels step output. It is not necessary to follow the input panels order as that can be wrong.

Grouping Panels and Interdependencies

- All panels depend on outputs from Panel 1. Therefore, we will place all panels in Group 1.
- Ensured that each API depends on at most one previous API's output.
- Ensured that dependencies are on the output from a previous panels for all such panel steps.
- Input variables that depend on previous outputs have matching names to maintain consistency.

Workflow Efficiency

- Kept the workflow minimal by:
  - Avoiding unnecessary APIs (e.g., not using BrowserTools where not essential).
  - Avoided calling the same api for same purpose multiple times by keeping such panels in the same group and sharing the api output with other panels.
  - Using city names directly when possible.
  - Limiting each panel to essential steps only.

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

Panel 1: Fetch G7 Countries and Capitals

• Understanding Panel Requirements:
  - The query asks which two G7 capital cities are the farthest apart.
  - First, we must identify the G7 countries and their respective capitals. 
  - Only BrowserTools is available for fetching external data from the web.

• API Selection:
  - BrowserTools: We will craft a query to retrieve the official list of G7 nations and the names of their capitals.

• Dependencies & Flow:
  - This panel does not rely on any prior panel output since it is our first step. 
  - The output from this panel (list of G7 capitals) will be required for the next panel.

• Variable Naming:
  - Input variable to BrowserTools: query_g7_capitals
  - Output variable from Panel 1: g7_capitals_list

Panel 2: Compute Capital-to-Capital Distances

• Understanding Panel Requirements:
  - Now that we have the G7 capitals, we need to get the distances between each pair of capital cities.
  - We will again use BrowserTools to gather the latitude and longitude for each city or directly retrieve the distances between each pair if a reliable resource is available.

• API Selection:
  - BrowserTools: We will query a suitable source that can give us the direct distances or lat-long data for each city. If lat-long data is found, we can compute or find the distance results from a known service or formula. Either way, it's done externally, so BrowserTools is the choice.

• Dependencies & Flow:
  - This panel depends on the output from Panel 1 (g7_capitals_list).
  - The output from this panel (g7_distance_data) will be required for the next panel.

• Variable Naming:
  - Input variable: g7_capitals_list (matching the output name from Panel 1).
  - Output variable: g7_distance_data (representing pairwise distance information between each G7 capital).

Panel 3: Determine Farthest Capitals in G7

• Understanding Panel Requirements:
  - We have the distance data for each pair of capitals from Panel 2.
  - We must find which two cities are the farthest apart, then return the corresponding countries in alphabetical order.

• API Selection:
  - ReasoningAgent: This is a pure reasoning/logical step, where we do not need external data. We only need to analyze the distance data provided by Panel 2 and identify the largest distance.

• Dependencies & Flow:
  - This panel depends on the output from Panel 2 (g7_distance_data).
  - No external resources are required, only internal reasoning.

• Variable Naming:
  - Input variable: g7_distance_data
  - Output variable: farthest_capitals (the final result containing two countries in alphabetical order)

#### Example 7:

Query: I have a partial blueprint file named 'site_diagram.png' that shows some labeled columns and partial floor markings for a new shopping complex. It doesn’t explicitly mention the total number of shops or whether there is a basement or rooftop garden. Please determine how many shops are planned for this complex, whether a basement level exists, and if there is a rooftop garden. The file shows only partial labels like '1F', '2F', and an incomplete scribble near the top.

Attachment: "file:///Users/aarjun1/Documents/Arjun/Princeton_Work/newCode/interpreter-translator-rapid_apis_GAIA_Simple/GAIA/2023/validation/site_diagram.png"
Attachment file content:
- Partial text reading "Flo..." near some staircases
- Faint outline of two floors labeled "1F" and "2F"
- A partially scribbled rooftop outline with no clear label
- No visible mention of basement or total shops
- Some note referencing "Column A, Column B" but not enough detail to confirm total floors or shops

Interpreter's Panel Requests:
1. Panel 1: Analyze Blueprint Image
Details: Use BrowserTools to analyze 'site_diagram.png'. Extract any text, labels for floors, references to basements, rooftop structures, and approximate shop counts if mentioned.

Strongly mention that this panel depends on the outputs from Panel 1 to refine the search query, not forming an independent search approach.
List of Relevant APIs:
   - BrowserTools

3. Panel 3: Consolidate Building Details
Details: Use the ReasoningAgent to combine the partial blueprint analysis from Panel 1 and the external references from Panel 2. Determine the total number of shops, whether there is a basement level, and if a rooftop garden is included. This panel depends on Panels 1 and 2 for all data and performs pure reasoning on that data.
List of Relevant APIs:
   - ReasoningAgent

Description of APIs:

[Will be given to you]

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

Panel 1: Analyze Blueprint Image

- Understanding Panel Details:
  - The query wants us to analyze a partial blueprint file named "site_diagram.png" to extract any indication of the building's total shops, basement existence, and potential rooftop garden.
  - Since the file content does not fully specify all these details, we must visually parse the blueprint for textual or graphical hints.
  - BrowserTools is the only option for external data retrieval and image analysis.

- API Selection:
  - BrowserTools: Required to perform image analysis on the blueprint since the partial file content alone does not give complete information.

- Input / Output Requirements:
  - We will pass the image file path to BrowserTools, instructing it to detect any references to floors, basement levels, rooftop structures, or number of shops.

- Interdependencies:
  - This is the first panel; it has no dependencies on a previous panel.
  - The resulting extracted blueprint data will feed into subsequent panels.

- Variable Naming:
  - Input variable name: blueprint_path
  - Output variable name: blueprint_analysis

Panel 2: Gather External References

- Understanding Panel Details:
  - After analyzing the partial blueprint, we may discover partial references or project codes that prompt a web search for more comprehensive details (such as total shops, building specs).
  - We must use BrowserTools again to check official building references, developer sites, or local building codes.

- API Selection:
  - BrowserTools: We refine the search based on any data extracted from Panel 1’s blueprint analysis (e.g., project name, design codes, partial references).

- Input / Output Requirements:
  - The partial blueprint details from Panel 1 will guide our search queries.
  - We gather more precise data about total shops, basement existence, or rooftop garden references from external sources.

- Interdependencies:
  - Panel 2 depends on Panel 1’s output (blueprint_analysis).
  - The search approach must not be independent but driven by the blueprint information.

- Variable Naming:
  - Input variable name: blueprint_analysis
  - Output variable name: external_references

Panel 3: Consolidate Building Details

- Understanding Panel Details:
  - We now have blueprint data (Panel 1) and external references (Panel 2).
  - A ReasoningAgent panel is needed to synthesize the final information about the total number of shops, basement presence, and rooftop garden features.

- API Selection:
  - ReasoningAgent: No additional external search is needed; this step is purely inferential, drawing on prior panels’ data.

- Input / Output Requirements:
  - Combine blueprint_analysis with external_references to determine the final building attributes.

- Interdependencies:
  - Depends on both Panel 1 (blueprint_analysis) and Panel 2 (external_references).
  - This final step draws all data together but does not add new searches.

- Variable Naming:
  - Input variables: blueprint_analysis, external_references
