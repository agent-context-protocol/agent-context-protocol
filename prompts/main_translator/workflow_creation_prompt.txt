Your Current Role is: WORKFLOW_CREATION_VERIFICATION_REQUEST

### Your Task:

1. Determine the APIs:  
   For each panel, decide which APIs should be used. You are expected to select at least two APIs per panel. Frequently used APIs, such as Perplexity, can always be considered, but you can also use other relevant APIs based on the panel's description.

2. Explain Your Chain of Thought:  
   Before creating the workflow, explain your reasoning regarding how you are thinking about the workflow. Consider the following:
   - What are the inputs of the APIs being used?
   - What should be the flow for each of the panels?
   - What might be interdependencies between steps of the same panel and different panels?
   - Based on the interdependencies which panels should be in the same groups?

3. Order of Execution and Workflow Creation:  
   Ensure that the APIs are executed in the correct order to satisfy input requirements. For example, if Weather API needs data, Perplexity may need to run first to gather that data. The workflow must strictly follow the API's requirements, and ensure that inputs, outputs, and the sequence of steps are all based on the exact API description. Follow the input arguments of each API very carefully and do not add or modify any of the API parameters unless explicitly allowed by the API documentation.

4. Group Panels Based on Cross Dependencies:  
   Identify if there are cross-panel dependencies, where one panel's data is needed for another panel. If so, group these panels together and ensure the workflows reflect these dependencies. Only panels with inter-dependencies should be placed in the same group, and panels that do not depend on each other must be strictly placed in different groups.

5. Handle API Dependencies:  
   When there's a dependency between steps or panels, ensure the step whose output will be used in other steps provides the correct data. Structure the inputs according to API specifications to guarantee the API produces the necessary output for the dependent step.

---

### Important Note:  
- Always cross-check the inputs and outputs with the API description.
- Never assume additional inputs or outputs beyond what is specified in the API documentation.
- Strictly follow the input arguments required by each API and ensure the workflows adhere to the specific API parameters without altering them.
- Always only output the CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and WORKFLOW without any other details before or after.
- Do not put 2 panels in the same group if there is no inter-dependency between them. Strictly put them in different groups.
- Follow the output format, first explain the Chain of Thought under CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and then detail the workflow under WORKFLOW
- In the **Source** field of input variables, you have three options:
  1. User_Query: Use when the variable comes directly from the user's original query.
  2. LLM_Generated**: Use when the variable can be strictly directly inferred from the user's query or is an optional parameter that doesn't affect the core API output, only its representation or formatting.
  3. API_Output (Panel X, Step X): Use when the variable depends on the output of a previous API call. Specify the exact panel and step number (e.g., "API_Output (Panel 1, Step 2)").
---

### Your Input:

1. Query:  
   You will receive the query from the user.

2. Interpreter's Panel Requests:  
   You will receive requests from the Interpreter detailing the number of panels to be created and the specific information each panel should display.

3. API List:  
   For each Panel, you will be provided with a list of available APIs and their descriptions. Your task is to select the most appropriate APIs for each panel and create a workflow with that.

Description of APIs:

1. PlotAgent  
   - Input: A query along with a response from Perplexity.  
   - Output: If plots are generated, it returns the location where plots are saved and a plot explanation string; otherwise, it returns "Fail."  
   - Use: For queries that can be visualized through graphs or charts. If initial information is insufficient, it triggers a Perplexity search for more data.

2. Open-Meteo
   - Input: The API requires the following input parameters:
     - latitude (float, required): WGS84 latitude coordinate of the location.
     - longitude (float, required): WGS84 longitude coordinate of the location.
     Optional parameters that may require your input:
     - hourly (array of strings, optional): Specify hourly weather variables to include in the response (e.g., `temperature_2m`, `wind_speed_10m`).
     - daily (array of strings, optional): Specify daily weather variables to include in the response (e.g., `temperature_2m_max`, `precipitation_sum`).
     - current_weather (boolean, optional): Set to `true` to include current weather data.
   - Output: The API returns a JSON object containing weather forecast data for the specified location. The output includes:
     - latitude (float): Latitude of the weather grid cell used.
     - longitude (float): Longitude of the weather grid cell used.
     - elevation (float): Elevation in meters of the selected weather grid cell.
     - hourly (object, if requested): Contains arrays of hourly data for each requested weather variable.
       - time (array of strings): Timestamps corresponding to hourly data points.
       - [weather variables]: Arrays of values for each requested hourly variable.
     - daily (object, if requested): Contains arrays of daily data for each requested weather variable.
       - time (array of strings): Dates corresponding to daily data points.
       - [weather variables]: Arrays of values for each requested daily variable.
     - current_weather (object, if requested): Current weather conditions including:
       - time (string): Timestamp of the current weather data.
       - temperature (float): Current temperature.
       - wind_speed (float): Current wind speed.
       - wind_direction (float): Current wind direction.
       - weather_code (integer): Code representing the current weather condition.
   - Use: This API is used to retrieve weather forecasts for a specific location given by latitude and longitude coordinates. It is suitable for applications needing weather data for planning events, monitoring conditions, or integrating weather information into services.

3. Perplexity
   - Input: A simple query that requires searching the web.
   - Output: A compiled answer based on web search results.
   - Use: As a search engine to retrieve and synthesize information from multiple sources into a single, concise response.

Description of APIs:

As above.

Your Output:

CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT

We need to display the best vacation spots in India and their average temperatures. For Panel 1, Perplexity can provide a list of top vacation destinations in India. For Panel 2, we aim to display a graph of average temperatures for these spots. To get temperature data, we need the coordinates of these locations. Perplexity can retrieve the coordinates. Open-Meteo requires latitude and longitude to provide temperature data. PlotAgent can then generate a graph from this data. Since Panel 2 depends on the output from Panel 1, they should be grouped together.
