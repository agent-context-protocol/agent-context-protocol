Your Current Role is: WORKFLOW_CREATION_REQUEST

### Your Task:

1. Determine the APIs:
   For each panel, decide which APIs should be used. You are expected to select at least two APIs per panel. Frequently used APIs, such as Perplexity, can always be considered, but you can also use other relevant APIs based on the panel's description.

2. Explain Your Chain of Thought:
   Before creating the workflow, explain your reasoning regarding how you are thinking about the workflow. Consider the following:
   - Which APIs to choose for each panel
   - What are the input parameters of the APIs being used? What is the type of data which the input parameter expects?
   - What would be the source for these parameters (LLM_Generated or API_Output). Use LLM_Generated only if we are inferring something from the query or the API description, Do not use your own knowledge about something to put in things, rather use perplexity to retireve information.
   - What should be the flow for each of the panels?
   - What might be interdependencies between steps of the same panel and different panels?
   - Based on the interdependencies, which panels should be in the same groups?
   - Ensure that each API depends on at most one previous API's output. If an API depends on outputs from more than one API, do not consider that workflow.

3. API Input Requirements:
   Be sure to check and understand the API input requirements very carefully and their data type, then only proceed to use them.

4. Order of Execution and Workflow Creation:
   Ensure that the APIs are executed in the correct order to satisfy input requirements. For example, if the Weather API needs data, Perplexity may need to run first to gather that data. The workflow must strictly follow the API's requirements, and ensure that inputs, outputs, and the sequence of steps are all based on the exact API description. Follow the input arguments of each API very carefully and do not add or modify any of the API parameters unless explicitly allowed by the API documentation.

5. Group Panels Based on Cross Dependencies:
   Identify if there are cross-panel dependencies, where one panel's data is needed for another panel. If so, group these panels together and ensure the workflows reflect these dependencies. Only panels with interdependencies should be placed in the same group, and panels that do not depend on each other must be strictly placed in different groups.

6. Handle API Dependencies:
   When there's a dependency between steps or panels, ensure the step whose output will be used in other steps provides the correct data. Structure the inputs according to API specifications to guarantee the API produces the necessary output for the dependent step.

---

### Important Note:

- Always cross-check the inputs and outputs with the API description.
- Never assume additional inputs or outputs beyond what is specified in the API documentation.
- Strictly follow the input arguments required by each API and ensure the workflows adhere to the specific API parameters without altering them.
- Always only output the CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and WORKFLOW without any other details before or after.
- Do not put two panels in the same group if there is no interdependency between them. Strictly put them in different groups.
- Follow the output format, first explain the Chain of Thought under CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT and then detail the workflow under WORKFLOW.
- Variable names should strictly be unique for all the variables in the workflow (across panels in a group)
- In the Source field of input variables, you have two options:
  1. LLM_Generated: Use when the variable can be directly inferred from the user's query or API description or is an optional parameter that doesn't affect the core API output, only its representation or formatting. Do not use your own knowledge about something to put in things, rather use perplexity to retireve information.
  2. API_Output (Panel X, Step X): Use when the variable depends on the output of a previous API call. Specify the exact panel and step number (e.g., "API_Output (Panel 1, Step 2)").
- For input variables:
  - Add a `Name` key which tells the variable name of the value we will give to the parameter. Variable name should be unique across panels in a group.
  - Add a `Source` key, it can either be set to LLM_Generated or API_Output.
  - Add a `Description` key, which describes the variable and how do we intend to use it
  - Add a `Parameter` key, which specifies the exact parameter name as required by the API documentation to which this input variable value should be assigned.
  - Add a `Type` key, which specifies the expected data type of the parameter based on the API documentation.
  - Add a `Value` key, which is only filled when the source is LLM_Generated; it stores the value of the variable generated based on the user query and what the step in the panel is handling. If the source is API_Output, the Value should be None.
- Be sure to use the same variable name when utilizing information from the output variable of some previous panel.

  - No interdependencies within this panel.
- No API depends on more than one APIs output to construct its input

### Panel 2:

- APIs Used: Perplexity, Open-Meteo, PlotAgent
- Flow:
  1. Step 1: Use Perplexity to get the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the vacation spots identified in Panel 1. Because we cannot guess the latitude and longitude, better to search it on the web.
  2. Step 2: Use Open-Meteo to fetch the average temperature data for each location using the coordinates.
  3. Step 3: Use PlotAgent to generate a graph based on the retrieved temperature data.
  
- Input Parameters and Sources:

  Step 1 (Perplexity):
  - Input Parameters:
    - `query` (string): A query to fetch the coordinates for each vacation spot.
  - Type of Data Expected:
    - The `query` parameter expects a string value.
  - Source of Parameters:
    - The `query` will be based on the API_Output (Panel 1, Step 1), i.e., the list of vacation spots retrieved earlier.

  Step 2 (Open-Meteo):
  - Input Parameters:
    - `latitude` (float): The latitude of the vacation spot.
    - `longitude` (float): The longitude of the vacation spot.
    - `daily` (array of strings): Weather variables for daily data.
  - Type of Data Expected:
    - The `latitude` and `longitude` parameters expect float values.
    - The `daily` parameter expects an array of strings.
  - Source of Parameters:
    - `latitude` and `longitude` will be sourced from API_Output (Panel 2, Step 1), which provides the coordinates for each vacation spot.
    - `daily` is LLM_Generated and will request the daily maximum temperature ("temperature_2m_max").

  Step 3 (PlotAgent):
  - Input Parameters:
    - `query` (string): The data for generating the graph.
  - Type of Data Expected:
    - The `query` parameter expects a string value.

Query: "What are the key statistics on climate change in the past 50 years?"

Interpreter's Panel Requests:
1. Panel 1: Key Statistics on Climate Change
   - List of Relevant APIs:
     - Perplexity
     - PlotAgent

Description of APIs:

_As above._

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

For Panel 1, we need to gather key statistics on climate change over the past 50 years. The Perplexity API will be used to search for this information. Perplexity requires a query string, which will be generated based on the user query. The response will contain the climate change statistics needed for visualization.

In Step 2, we will use PlotAgent to create visualizations from the data retrieved by Perplexity. PlotAgent requires data (in the form of statistics) as input. The input for PlotAgent will come directly from the API output of Step 1. Since there are no dependencies between different panels, all steps are confined within a single group.

- **Input Parameters and Sources:**
  - **Step 1 (Perplexity):** Takes a query string as input. The `query` will be **LLM_Generated**.
  - **Step 2 (PlotAgent):** Takes the climate change statistics as input. This will be sourced from **API_Output (Panel 1, Step 1)**.
  
- **Flow:** 
  1. Perplexity will retrieve the key statistics on climate change.
  2. PlotAgent will then visualize the statistics retrieved by Perplexity.

- No API depends on more than one APIs output to construct its input

- **Interdependencies:** 
  There are no cross-panel dependencies. All steps occur within the same group.

Example 3:

Query: "Provide information about renewable energy sources and display the current weather in New York City."

Interpreter's Panel Requests:
1. Panel 1: Information about Renewable Energy Sources
   - List of Relevant APIs:
     - Perplexity
2. Panel 2: Current Weather in New York City
   - List of Relevant APIs:
     - Perplexity
     - Open-Meteo

Description of APIs:

_As above._

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

For Panel 1, we need to provide detailed information on renewable energy sources. Perplexity will be used to gather this information, with a query string generated from the user's request.

In Panel 2, the task is to display the current weather in New York City. The Perplexity API will first retrieve the latitude and longitude of New York City, followed by Open-Meteo, which will fetch the weather data based on these coordinates. Both APIs expect specific input parameters: `query` for Perplexity and `latitude`, `longitude`, and `current_weather` for Open-Meteo.

Since these panels address different topics with no dependencies, they will be placed in separate groups.

- **Input Parameters and Sources:**
  - **Panel 1 (Perplexity):** The `query` will be **LLM_Generated** to search for renewable energy information.
  - **Panel 2 (Perplexity and Open-Meteo):**
    - Perplexity will generate the coordinates of New York City, with the `query` **LLM_Generated**.
    - Open-Meteo will use these coordinates, which will be sourced from **API_Output (Panel 2, Step 1)**. Additionally, `current_weather` will be **LLM_Generated** with a value of `true`.

- **Flow:**
  1. Panel 1 will fetch detailed information about renewable energy sources.
  2. Panel 2 will retrieve the coordinates of New York City and use these to fetch the current weather conditions. Better to not guess the coordinates of New York City.

- No API depends on more than one APIs output to construct its input
  
- **Interdependencies:** 
  No interdependencies exist between the two panels, so they will be grouped separately.
