# Assume 1 cup of honey weighs approximately 340 grams, and
# 1 cup of mayonnaise weighs approximately 240 grams.

weight_of_honey_per_cup = 340  # in grams
weight_of_mayo_per_cup = 240   # in grams

# Given that 6 cups of honey need to be removed
cups_honey_removed = 6

# Calculate the total weight of honey removed
total_weight_honey_removed = cups_honey_removed * weight_of_honey_per_cup

# Result
