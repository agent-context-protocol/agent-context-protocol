U2\n3. Metallica\n4. Led Zeppelin\n5. Lost\n\nBelow are brief backgrounds on each:\n\n**Iron Maiden**  \nIron Maiden is a legendary British heavy metal band formed in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris. Renowned for their energetic live performances and iconic mascot \\\"Eddie,\\\" Iron Maiden played a major role in the new wave of British heavy metal, influencing countless bands worldwide. Major albums include *The Number of the Beast*, *Powerslave*, and *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son*.\n\n**U2**  \nU2 is an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in 1976, consisting of Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen Jr. Known for their soaring sound and socially conscious lyrics, U2 achieved global stardom with albums like *The Joshua Tree* and *Achtung Baby*, and are celebrated for their activism and innovation in music.\n\n**Metallica**  \nMetallica is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1981. Founded by drummer Lars Ulrich and guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield, Metallica is one of the most influential metal bands, credited with pioneering thrash metal. Their best-known albums are *Master of Puppets*, *Ride the Lightning*, and the self-titled \\\"Black Album.\\\"\n\n**Led Zeppelin**  \nLed Zeppelin, formed in London in 1968, was composed of Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham. Often credited as one of the founders of hard rock and heavy metal, their signature blend included blues, psychedelia, and folk influences. Their most iconic songs include \\\"Stairway to Heaven,\\\" \\\"Whole Lotta Love,\\\" and \\\"Kashmir.\\\"\n\n**Lost**  \nLost is listed as one of the top artists by revenue in the Chinook Database, but unlike the other names here, \\\"Lost\\\" appears to be a placeholder or possibly a lesser-known or fictional artist included for database completeness. No major artist by this exact name is widely recognized in popular music history, indicating it may be a sample entry in Chinook's dataset rather than a real-world band or performer.\n\nThese artists reflect a mix of classic rock and metal staples, frequently featured in digital music store datasets such as Chinook's.\""
