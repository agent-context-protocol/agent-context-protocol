                        "value": "\"As of 5:12 AM UTC on Monday, April 14, 2025, Seattle, Washington, experiences overcast skies with temperatures hovering between 48\u00b0F (9\u00b0C) and 54\u00b0F (12\u00b0C), reflecting the transitional spring weather typical for the region during this period. The humidity levels remain moderate, ranging from 61% to 66%, while wind speeds are calm, predominantly blowing from the west-southwest at 1\u20136 mph. These conditions align with historical climatological patterns for mid-April, characterized by fluctuating temperatures and intermittent cloud cover as Pacific weather systems influence the area. The current weather in Seattle as of April 14, 2025, early morning UTC, is overcast with temperatures around 48-54\u00b0F, light winds, and possible light rain showers, based on the most recent and relevant search results. The University of Washington\u2019s Department of Atmospheric Sciences forecasts a gradual warming trend through the week, with highs expected to reach the mid-50s\u00b0F by April 17. April is Seattle\u2019s sixth-driest month, with an average rainfall of 66 mm (2.6 inches) spread over 13 days. Current conditions reflect this pattern, as light rain showers are reported in the vicinity, contributing to the month\u2019s cumulative precipitation. Surface wind currents are influenced by the thermal contrast between the Pacific Ocean and inland areas. The current west-southwesterly flow at 1\u20136 mph reflects weak pressure gradients typical of spring. Barometric pressure readings of 30.63 inches (1037 hPa) indicate stable atmospheric conditions, though a gradual decline is expected as a frontal system approaches from the Gulf of Alaska. The National Weather Service anticipates mostly cloudy skies persisting through the morning, with a high near 54\u00b0F. By afternoon, scattered showers may develop, particularly north of the city center, though rainfall accumulations will likely remain below 0.1 inches. Winds will shift to the north-northeast at 5\u201310 mph, reinforcing cooler air advection and maintaining daytime highs slightly below seasonal averages. A strengthening upper-level trough over British Columbia will enhance precipitation chances by midweek, with periods of moderate rain expected from April 15\u201317. Daytime temperatures will climb to the upper 50s\u00b0F by April 16, accompanied by southwesterly winds gusting to 20 mph. These conditions may increase landslide risks in steep terrain, particularly after antecedent rainfall saturates soils. Seattle\u2019s April 2025 weather epitomizes the Pacific Northwest\u2019s maritime climate\u2014characterized by mild temperatures, frequent cloud cover, and intermittent precipitation. While short-term fluctuations occur, the overarching patterns remain consistent with historical norms, underscoring the region\u2019s climatic stability amid global environmental changes.\""
