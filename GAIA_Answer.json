"Global warming characterized by significant scientific findings, key events, and observable trends underscores urgent need for climate action. Human activities, particularly emission of greenhouse gases like CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide, primary drivers of climate change. Global surface temperatures increased approximately 1.1\u00b0C since late 19th century. China largest emitter, contributing about 35% of global CO2 emissions. United States high per capita emissions. Global CO2 emissions increased from 6 billion tonnes in 1950 to over 35 billion tonnes annually. Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C. AI can potentially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 4% to 16% by 2030. Public awareness crucial in shaping perceptions and behaviors driving change in carbon emissions."
